## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with Chronicle Sniffer, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud account
- Basic knowledge of Docker and Terraform
- Access to your local network

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Iriiiiii83838/chronicle-sniffer.git
   cd chronicle-sniffer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Ensure you have Terraform installed. If not, follow the [Terraform installation guide](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

## Usage üìä

To start using Chronicle Sniffer, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will start the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Capturing Traffic

Use the following command to start capturing traffic:

```bash
tshark -i <interface> -w capture.pcap
```

Replace `<interface>` with your network interface name.

### Analyzing Data

Once you have captured the data, you can send it to GCP for analysis. Use the following command:

```bash
gcloud pubsub topics publish <topic-name> --message <path-to-capture.pcap>
```

Replace `<topic-name>` with your Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Configuration files are located in the `config` directory. Adjust the settings to fit your environment. Key configurations include:

- **GCP Credentials**: Ensure your service account has the necessary permissions.
- **Network Interface**: Specify the interface for tshark to capture.

## Deployment ‚òÅÔ∏è

Deploying Chronicle Sniffer to GCP can be done using Terraform. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `terraform` directory:
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

This will set up all necessary resources in your Google Cloud environment.
